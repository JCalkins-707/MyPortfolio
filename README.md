# Julia's Code Portfolio

My name is Julia Calkins, I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt. This is my code portfolio.

My goal for this repository is to demonstrate not only my technical competency, but also my ability to grasp concepts quickly and effectively. These projects are only a sample of my capabilities. Please reach out to me if you wish to discuss anything further with me.

Thank you for reading and email me with any questions.
