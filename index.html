        <hr>

        <p id="bio_blurb"> I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal Poly
            Humboldt. My expected graduation date is in Spring 2026.
            My interests are in cybersecurity, web development,
            database management, game design, and robotics. In my
            free time I am coming up with project ideas or
            playing video games. </p>

            <p> This project was for the Cal Poly Humboldt Hackathon
                for Social Good in Spring 2025. I collaborated with 3
                other teammates to make a web application in approximately
                20 hours. My primary role was database design and
                management. I created the database and ensured it was
                kept consistent between the model and the framework.
                We used the Django framework and MariaDB.</p><p>This project
                placed in the top 3 for the hackathon.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="complete"> This project is being continued post-Hackathon. </p>

            <h3> Database Prototype for CS 325 </h3>
            <p> This was a group assignment with two classmates 
                and I. The goal was to create a prototype
                database, including a model and scenario, that could
                simulate something a real business might use. Our project
                featured PL/SQL triggers, formatted reports, 24+ distinct
                SQL queries, and an ERD, among other things.

            <p> This database was made for the Web-Apps Using
                Databases course in Cal Poly Humboldt. I created it
                from the ground up in order to refresh myself on SQL
                and database design. I used my work experience at a
                hotel front desk in order to consider how a database
                would be utilized by such a business.

                allocation, C++ classes and objects.
